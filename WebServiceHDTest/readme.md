# Deploying WebServiceHDTest for Tomcat #

This project comes built with the Handset Detection library generated from HDlib.
To re-generate the library or rebuild that project see the readme at the project root.

## Update the Config File ##

Before deploying this servlet you'll need an account at http://www.handsetdetecction.com and access credentials. Once you have that information update the config file at target/WebServiceHDTest-4.x.x/WEB-INF/hdapi_config.properties 

Find the full path to target/WebServiceHDTest-4.x.x/ and deploy it in Tomcat.
